Helping to provide music online classes to Detroit elementary, middle, and high schools who lack music programs. Detroit School Arts programs took a big hit when the district was under the control of state-appointed emergency managers from 2009 until last year 2021. During years without these programs, many Detroit schools lost the equipment they once had to theft or lack of maintenance of the condition of instruments and other supplies. Most of Detroit city's high schools have at least some kind of arts program. Large selective schools like Cass Tech, Renaissance and the Detroit School of the Arts offer several such programs. But some smaller high schools don't currently offer music or art. Numbers provided by the Detroit districts show that of 81 schools serving general education students, 55 had no art teachers, and 51 had no instrumental or vocal music teachers during the school year that just ended. Nearly half — 40 schools — offered neither music nor arts instruction. The Satori Missions with the help of Tailured.live aims to eventually offer music online classes to every Detroit elementary and middle school."
